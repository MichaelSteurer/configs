# Configuration Files

The files in the repository's directory */configs* are links to the actual file location. For instance */configs/jed/jedrc* is a link to the file *~/.jedrc* on your localhost. 
Unfortunately, git does not allow to add symbolic-links and there are no more native hard-links on OSX. To maintain a connection between the files in this repository and the actual file on your localhost use *[hln](https://github.com/selkhateeb)*.
